DrawerWidget
======

This is an Appcelerator Alloy widget to implement a nice "drawer-type" menu on you iOS and Android Apps.  This new version 2.0 was a bit refactored, simplifying the way you interact with the widget, and adding swipe functionality.

This Widget exposes two views: drawermenuview and drawermainview


Getting started
======
This widget simply gives you a container to which you can add two views: the menu view and the main view.  Open/Close of the menu can be triggered by either a button you add to your main view, or by swiping with your finger.  

Assuming you have a view called **menu** and a view called **main**, simply add this to the index.js of your app:

````javascript
$.drawermenu.init({
    menuview:menu,
    mainview:main,
    duration:200,
    parent: $.index
})
````

That's all.  At this point you have a swipeable area that shows the menu by swiping to the right.

If you add a "menu button" to your main view, simply add an event listener like this:

````javascript
	var menubutton.addEventListener('click',function(e){
		$.drawermenu.showhidemenu();
	})
````
